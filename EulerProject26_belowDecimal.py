# Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

'''
1. construct an array arr with 1/1, 1/2, ... 1/999 (size 999)
2. Using round(arr[i], 2000), truncated up to 2000th digit.
3. using while loop, calculate j*arr - arr and only examine the below decimals:
# number_dec = str(number-int(number))[1:]
